# Predicting Loan Applications

### Investigating Loan Applications

**Author:** Christopher Hunt Jr.

### Business Challenge:

Financial institutions are tasked with accurately evaluating the risk involved in approving loan applications. A common concern is understanding whether customers are creditworthy and likely to repay loans. To address this, comprehensive customer data is crucial for making well-informed lending decisions.

### Data Source:
- [Eligibility Prediction for Loan](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devzohaib/eligibility-prediction-for-loan)

### Data Dictionary:
- [Loan Data Dictionary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19zb-Z80Pt9fRZN7Khs8q3t3m3xrAu6bk/view?usp=sharing)

##### The data underwent a thorough cleaning process and then underwent Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

#### Exploratory Data Analysis:

- During the exploration phase, we used histograms, bar plots, and count plots to visually understand how data is distributed across columns. This method helped us gain insights into the loan application process.

- We observed a significant presence of male applicants, indicating a clear gender distribution in the dataset.
